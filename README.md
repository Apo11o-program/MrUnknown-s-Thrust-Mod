# SFS Thrust & Efficiency Mod

A powerful mod for **Spaceflight Simulator** that gives you god-like control over your rockets. Originally based on the [ThrustMod by MrUnknown](https://github.com/MrUnknown11/SFS-ThrustMod), this enhanced version adds **Fuel Efficiency (ISP) Control**, a completely redesigned UI, and better stability.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Thrust Multiplier:** Increase your engine power beyond game limits (x5, x10, or custom values).
* **Fuel Efficiency Control:** Change how fast your fuel burns.
    * Set to `0.5` for double efficiency.
    * Set to `0` for **Infinite Fuel** (0 burn rate).
* **Real-Time Adjustments:** Change settings mid-flight without restarting.
* **Smart UI:**
    * Draggable & Minimizable window.
    * Remembers window position between game sessions.
    * Type precise numbers or use stepper buttons (`<<<` `>>>`) for fine-tuning.

## 📥 Installation

1.  Download the latest `ThrustMod.dll` (or zip) from the **[Releases](../../releases)** page.
2.  Navigate to your Spaceflight Simulator installation folder:
    * **Steam:** `Steam\steamapps\common\Spaceflight Simulator\Spaceflight Simulator Game\Spaceflight Simulator_Data\MODS`
3.  Create a folder named `ThrustMod` (optional, but organized) and drop the `.dll` file inside.
4.  **Requirement:** Ensure you have the `UITools` mod installed (usually required for the window features).
5.  Launch the game!

## 🎮 How to Use

Once you are on the launch pad, a **"Thrust Control"** window will appear.

### Tab 1: Thrust
* **Presets:** Click `x1`, `x5`, or `x10` to instantly boost power.
* **Custom:** Type any number (e.g., `50`) into the box to set a custom multiplier.

### Tab 2: Fuel Usage
* This controls your engine's **ISP** (Specific Impulse).
* **Value 1.0:** Normal fuel usage (100%).
* **Value 0.5:** Engines burn fuel 50% slower (2x Efficiency).
* **Value 0:** Engines consume **no fuel** (Infinite).
* Use the arrow buttons (`<` `>`) to fine-tune the percentage while flying.
