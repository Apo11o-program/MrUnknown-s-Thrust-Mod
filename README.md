## Key Features

* **Thrust Multiplier:** Increase your engine power beyond game limits (x5, x10, or custom values).
* **Fuel Efficiency Control:** Change how fast your fuel burns.
    * Set to `0.5` for double efficiency.
    * Set to `0` for **Infinite Fuel** (0 burn rate).

## Installation

1.  Download the latest `UnknownMod.dll` (or zip) from the **[Releases](../../releases)** page.
2.  Navigate to your Spaceflight Simulator installation folder:
    * **Steam:** `Steam\steamapps\common\Spaceflight Simulator\Spaceflight Simulator Game\Spaceflight Simulator_Data\MODS`

4.  **Requirement:** Ensure you have the `UITools` mod installed (usually required for the window features).
5.  Launch the game!

## 🎮 How to Use

### Tab 1: Thrust
* **Presets:** Click `x1`, `x5`, or `x10` to instantly boost power.
* **Custom:** Type any number (e.g., `50`) into the box to set a custom multiplier.

### Tab 2: Fuel Usage
* This controls your engine's **ISP** (Specific Impulse).
* **Value 1.0:** Normal fuel usage (100%).
* **Value 0.5:** Engines burn fuel 50% slower (2x Efficiency).
* **Value 0:** Engines consume **no fuel** (Infinite).
* Use the arrow buttons (`<` `>`) to fine-tune the percentage while flying.
